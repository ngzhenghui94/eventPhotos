# Project Context
You are working on a web application called "Event Photos" that allows users to create and manage events, upload photos, and share them with guests. The application is built using Next.js, React, and TypeScript, with Tailwind CSS for styling. It integrates with various services such as Cloudinary for image hosting and Stripe for payment processing.
# Coding Guidelines
- Follow best practices for React and Next.js development, including component structure, state management, and hooks usage.
- Ensure TypeScript types are correctly defined and used throughout the codebase.
- Adhere to Tailwind CSS conventions for styling, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code, including comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
- Implement error handling and loading states for asynchronous operations.
- Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Ensure notification toats are used for user feedback on actions
- Use existing components and utilities from the codebase where applicable to maintain consistency.
# Success Criteria
- The code changes should meet the specified requirements and constraints.
- The application should function correctly without any bugs or errors.
- The code should not have any syntax errors or type issues.
- The UI should be visually appealing and consistent with the overall design of the application.
# Constraints
- Do not introduce any breaking changes to existing functionality.
- Ensure compatibility with the current versions of dependencies and libraries used in the project.
